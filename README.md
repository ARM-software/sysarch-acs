#  Unified Compliance Test Suites for Arm System Architecture Standards

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Arm `sysarch-acs`

This repository is a centralized collection of **compliance test suites** designed to validate conformance to a range of **Arm system architecture specifications**. It brings together reference implementations for verifying platform behavior against the following standards:

* **BSA** (Base System Architecture)
* **SBSA** (Server Base System Architecture)
* **SYS-MPAM** (System-level Memory Partitioning and Monitoring)
* **DRTM** (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement)

The goal of this repository is to provide a consistent and reusable framework for **system integrators**, **silicon vendors**, **firmware developers**, and **platform validation teams** to ensure their implementations meet architectural compliance requirements. These suites are platform-agnostic and can be integrated into both development and manufacturing validation pipelines.
