#  Unified Compliance Test Suites for Arm System Architecture Standards

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Arm `sysarch-acs`

This repository is a centralized collection of **compliance test suites** designed to validate conformance to a range of **Arm System Architecture Specifications**. It brings together reference implementations for verifying platform behavior against the following standards:

* **BSA** (Base System Architecture)
* **SBSA** (Server Base System Architecture)
* **SYS-MPAM** (System-level Memory Partitioning and Monitoring)
* **DRTM** (Dynamic Root of Trust for Measurement)

The goal of this repository is to provide a consistent and reusable framework for **system integrators**, **silicon vendors**, **firmware developers**, and **platform validation teams** to ensure their implementations meet architectural compliance requirements. These suites are platform-agnostic and can be integrated into both development and manufacturing validation pipelines.

## Unified Architecture Compliance Suite
Unified **Architecture Compliance Suite** (ACS) is a collection of self-checking, portable C-based tests.
This suite includes a set of examples of the invariant behaviors that are provided by the [BSA](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0094/d/?lang=en) and [SBSA]() specification, so that implementers can verify if these behaviours have been interpreted correctly.

Most of the tests are executed from UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) Shell by executing the ACS UEFI shell application.
A few tests are executed by running the BSA ACS Linux application which in turn depends on the BSA ACS Linux kernel module.
The tests can also be executed in a Bare-metal environment. The initialization of the Bare-metal environment is specific to the environment and is out of scope of this document.

## BSA - Architecture Compliance Suite

BSA **Architecture Compliance Suite** (ACS) is a collection of self-checking, portable C-based tests.
This suite includes a set of examples of the invariant behaviors that are provided by the [BSA](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0094/d/?lang=en) specification, so that implementers can verify if these behaviours have been interpreted correctly.

Most of the tests are executed from UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) Shell by executing the ACS UEFI shell application.
A few tests are executed by running the BSA ACS Linux application which in turn depends on the BSA ACS Linux kernel module.
The tests can also be executed in a Bare-metal environment. The initialization of the Bare-metal environment is specific to the environment and is out of scope of this document.

## Release details

 - The tests are written for version 1.1 of the BSA specification.
 - The tests can be run at both the Pre-Silicon and Silicon level.
 - For complete coverage of the BSA rules, availability of an Exerciser is required for Exerciser tests to be run during verficiation at Pre-Silicon level.
 - The compliance suite is not a substitute for design verification.
 - To review the BSA ACS logs, Arm licensees can contact Arm directly through their partner managers.
 - To know about the BSA rules not implemented in this release, see the [Test Scenario Document](docs/bsa/arm_bsa_architecture_compliance_test_scenario.pdf).

### Running Exerciser tests for complete coverage

Exerciser is a client device wrapped up by PCIe Endpoint. This device is created to meet BSA requirements for various PCIe capability validation tests. Running the Exerciser tests provides additional test coverage on the platform.

Note: To run the exerciser tests on a UEFI Based platform with Exerciser, the Exerciser PAL API's need to be implemented. For details on the reference Exerciser implementation and support, see the [Exerciser.md](docs/pcie/Exerciser.md) and [Exerciser_API_porting_guide.md](docs/pcie/Exerciser_API_porting_guide.md)

### 2. Test suite execution

#### Prerequisites
- If the system supports LPIs (Interrupt ID > 8192) then Firmware should support installation of handler for LPI interrupts.
    - If you are using edk2, change the ArmGic driver in the ArmPkg to support installation of handler for LPIs.
    - Add the following in edk2/ArmPkg/Drivers/ArmGic/GicV3/ArmGicV3Dxe.c
>        - After [#define ARM_GIC_DEFAULT_PRIORITY  0x80]
>          +#define ARM_GIC_MAX_NUM_INTERRUPT 16384
>        - Change this in GicV3DxeInitialize function.
>          -mGicNumInterrupts      = ArmGicGetMaxNumInterrupts (mGicDistributorBase);
>          +mGicNumInterrupts      = ARM_GIC_MAX_NUM_INTERRUPT;

The execution of the compliance suite varies depending on the test environment. The following steps assume that the test suite is invoked through the ACS UEFI shell application.

#### 2.1 Silicon

On a system where a USB port is available and functional, perform the following steps:

#### For IR Systems:
1. Copy 'Bsa.efi' and 'Shell.efi' to a USB Flash drive.
2. Boot the system to U-Boot shell.
3. Plug in the USB flash drive to one of the functional USB ports on the system.
4. To determine the file system number of the plugged-in USB drive, execute command <br />
   `usb start`
5. Copy the 'Shell.efi' to memory location using the command <br />
   `Syntax: fatload usb <dev_num> ${kernel_addr_r} Shell.efi` <br />
   `Eg: fatload usb 0 ${kernel_addr_r} Shell.efi` <br />
   This boots the system to UEFI Shell.
6. To determine the file system number of the plugged-in USB drive, execute 'map -r' command.
7. Type 'fs<x>' where '<x>' is replaced by the number determined in step 5.
8. To start the compliance tests, run the executable Bsa.efi with the appropriate parameters.
9. Copy the UART console output to a log file.
Note: 'Shell.efi' is available in the [pebuilt_images/IR](prebuilt_images)

#### 2.2 Emulation environment with secondary storage
On an emulation environment with secondary storage, perform the following steps:

1. Create an image file which contains the '.efi' file. For example:
  - mkfs.vfat -C -n HD0 hda.img 2097152
  - sudo mount -o rw,loop=/dev/loop0,uid=\`whoami\`,gid=\`whoami\` hda.img /mnt/acs
    In case loop0 is busy, please specify the one that is free.
  - sudo cp  "<path to application>/<efi binary>" /mnt/acs/
  - sudo umount /mnt/acs
2. Load the image file to the secondary storage using a backdoor. The steps to load the image file are emulation environment-specific and beyond the scope of this document.
3. Boot the system to UEFI shell.
4. To determine the file system number of the secondary storage, execute 'map -r' command.
5. Type 'fs<x>' where '<x>' is replaced by the number determined in step 4.
6. To start the compliance tests, run the executable Bsa.efi with the appropriate parameters.
7. Copy the UART console output to a log file for analysis and certification.

  - For information on the uefi shell application parameters, see the [BSA User Guide](docs/bsa/arm_bsa_architecture_compliance_user_guide.pdf) and [SBSA USer Guide](docs/sbsa/arm_sbsa_architecture_compliance_user_guide.pdf)


#### 2.3 Emulation environment without secondary storage

On an emulation platform where secondary storage is not available, perform the following steps:

1. Add the path to '<acs>.efi' file in the UEFI FD file.
2. Build UEFI image including the UEFI Shell.
3. Boot the system to UEFI shell.
4. Run the executable '<acs>.efi' to start the compliance tests. For details about the parameters,see the [BSA User Guide](docs/arm_bsa_architecture_compliance_user_guide.pdf) and [SBSA USer Guide](docs/sbsa/arm_sbsa_architecture_compliance_user_guide.pdf)
5. Copy the UART console output to a log file for analysis and certification.


## ACS build steps - Linux application

Certain Peripheral, PCIe and Memory map tests require Linux operating system.This chapter provides information on building and executing these tests from the Linux application.

### 1. Build steps and environment setup
This section lists the porting and build steps for the kernel module.
The patch for the kernel tree and the Linux PAL are hosted separately on [syscomp_linux_acs](https://ap-gerrit-1.ap01.arm.com/admin/repos/avk/syscomp_linux_acs) repository

### 1.1 Building the kernel module
#### Prerequisites
- Linux kernel source version 5.11, 5.13, 5.15, 6.0, 6.4, 6.7, 6.8
- Install GCC-ARM 13.2 [toolchain](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).
- Build environment for AArch64 Linux kernel.<br />
NOTE: <br />
- Linux version 6.8 is recommended version.

#### Porting steps for Linux kernel
1. git clone ssh://ap-gerrit-1.ap01.arm.com:29418/avk/syscomp_linux_acs linux-acs
2. git clone ssh://ap-gerrit-1.ap01.arm.com:29418/avk/syscomp_bsa bsa-acs
3. git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux.git -b v6.8
4. export CROSS_COMPILE=<GCC13.2 toolchain path> pointing to /bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
5. git apply <local_dir>/linux-acs/kernel/src/0001-BSA-ACS-Linux-6.8.patch to your kernel source tree.
6. make ARCH=arm64 defconfig && make -j $(nproc) ARCH=arm64

NOTE: The steps mentions Linux version 6.8, as it is latest version which is verified at ACS end.

#### 1.2 Build steps for BSA kernel module
1. cd <local_dir>/linux-acs/files
2. export CROSS_COMPILE=<ARM64 toolchain path>/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
3. export KERNEL_SRC=<linux_kernel_path>
4. ./bsa_setup.sh <local_dir/bsa-acs>
5. ./linux_bsa_acs.sh

Successful completion of above steps will generate bsa_acs.ko

#### 1.3 BSA Linux application build
1. cd <bsa-acs path>/linux_app/bsa-acs-app
2. export CROSS_COMPILE=<ARM64 toolchain path>/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-
3. make

Successful completion of above steps will generate executable file bsa

### 2. Loading the kernel module
Before the BSA ACS Linux application can be run, load the BSA ACS kernel module using the insmod command.
```sh
shell> insmod bsa_acs.ko
```

### 3. Running BSA ACS
```sh
shell> ./bsa
```
  - For information on the BSA Linux application parameters, see the [User Guide](docs/arm_bsa_architecture_compliance_user_guide.pdf).

## ACS build steps - Bare-metal abstraction

The Bare-metal build environment is platform specific.

To provide a baseline, the build steps to integrate and run the Bare-metal tests from UEFI shell are provided in [README.md](pal/baremetal/target/RDN2/README.md).

For details on generating the binaries to run on Bare-metal environment, refer [README.md](pal/baremetal/README.md)

## ACS build steps - Memory model consistency tests
To evaluate the correctness and consistency of a system's memory model, memory model consistency tests (litmus tests) can be optionally built into BSA UEFI application,
the build and run steps are provided in [mem_test/README.md](mem_test/README.md).

## Security implication
The Arm SystemReady ACS test suite may run at a higher privilege level. An attacker may utilize these tests to elevate the privilege which can potentially reveal the platform security assets. To prevent the leakage of Secure information, Arm strongly recommends that you run the ACS test suite only on development platforms. If it is run on production systems, the system should be scrubbed after running the test suite.

## Limitations

 - For systems that present firmware compliant to SBBR, BSA depends on SPCR acpi table to get UART information.
   UEFI console setting must be set to "serial" on these systems.
 - ITS test are available only for systems that present firmware compliant to SBBR.
 - Some PCIe and Exerciser test are dependent on PCIe features supported by the test system.
   Please fill the required API's with test system information.
   - pal_pcie_p2p_support : If the test system PCIe supports peer to peer transaction.
   - pal_pcie_is_cache_present : If the test system supports PCIe address translation cache.
   - pal_pcie_get_legacy_irq_map : Fill system legacy irq map

   Below exerciser capabilities are required by exerciser test.
   - MSI-X interrupt generation.
   - Incoming Transaction Monitoring(order, type).
   - Initiating transacions from and to the exerciser.
   - Ability to check on BDF and register address seen for each configuration address along with access type.

### SBSA Tests dependencies
 - MPAM tests will require EL3 firmware to enable access to MPAM registers from lower EL's.
   If arm trusted firmware is used as EL3 fimrware, enable ENABLE_MPAM_FOR_LOWER_ELS=1 during arm TF build.
   If the above flags are not enabled, MPAM tests can lead to exception at EL3.
 - RAS test will require EL3 firmware to enable access to RAS registers from lower EL's and forward RAS related exceptions to lower EL's.
   If arm trusted firmware is used as EL3 fimrware, enable EL3_EXCEPTION_HANDLING=1 RAS_EXTENSION=1 HANDLE_EA_EL3_FIRST=1 RAS_TRAP_LOWER_EL_ERR_ACCESS=0 during arm TF build
   If the above flags are not enabled, RAS tests can lead to exception at EL3.
 - SBSA Future Requirements ETE test will require EL3 firmware to enable access to Trace registers from lower EL's.
   If arm trusted firmware is used as EL3 fimrware, ENABLE_TRF_FOR_NS=1 ENABLE_TRBE_FOR_NS=1 ENABLE_SYS_REG_TRACE_FOR_NS=1 during arm TF build
   If the above flags are not enabled, ETE tests can lead to exception at EL3.
 - MPAM test have dependency on MPAM, SRAT, HMAT, PPTT tables.
 - RAS test have dependency on AEST, RAS2, SRAT, HMAT, PPTT tables.
 - PMU test have dependency on APMT table.
 - Entrophy rule will require ACS to build with NIST-STS package

**Note:** To build the ACS with NIST Statistical Test Suite, see the [arm SBSA_NIST_User_Guide Document](docs/sbsa/arm_sbsa_nist_user_guide.md)
