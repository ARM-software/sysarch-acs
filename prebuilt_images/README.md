# ACS Prebuilt Images and Legacy Access

This repository provides **prebuilt ACS images** for partners and users for each release version.

---

## Current Prebuilt Images
The latest **unified prebuilt binaries** for all ACS suites supported under `sysarch-acs` are available here:

ðŸ‘‰ [sysarch-acs/prebuilt_images](https://github.com/ARM-software/sysarch-acs/tree/main/prebuilt_images)

This is the single location for downloading prebuilt images for BSA, SBSA, PC-BSA, and other ACS supported in `sysarch-acs`.

---

## Legacy Prebuilt Images
For historical builds (prior to the consolidation into `sysarch-acs`), prebuilt binaries remain available:

- **BSA prebuilt images**: [bsa-acs/prebuilt_images](https://github.com/ARM-software/bsa-acs/tree/main/prebuilt_images)  
- **SBSA prebuilt images**: [sbsa-acs/prebuilt_images](https://github.com/ARM-software/sbsa-acs/tree/master/prebuilt_images)

These are preserved only for reference and backward compatibility.

---

## Going Forward
- All new ACS builds will be published in the [sysarch-acs](https://github.com/ARM-software/sysarch-acs) repository.  
- Prebuilt binaries from future specifications will be integrated and made available in the unified prebuilt location.  
- Partners should use the `sysarch-acs` prebuilt images for the most up-to-date and supported releases.
